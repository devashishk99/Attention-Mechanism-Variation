The following repo consists of a Design Report for Neural Machine Translation suggesting a modification of using beam search at inference time 
on a seq2seq model with additive attention mechanism proposed in the paper ’NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION BY JOINTLY LEARNING TO ALIGN AND TRANSLATE’ 
by Dzmitry Bahdanau, KyungHyun Cho and Yoshua Bengio
